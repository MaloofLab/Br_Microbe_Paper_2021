```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We have leaf growth data for Mark.  I want to bring this in and get it associated with the appropriate metabolite data.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

## experiment 1

get leaf data
```{r}
leafexp1 <- read_excel("exp1_leaf_ln_data.xlsx", sheet = 2) %>%
  mutate(data_type = str_replace(data_type,"Phys", "phys")) %>%
  filter(data_type=="phys",
         time_point=="wk2")
leafexp1
```

just keep the data we need
```{r}
leafexp1 <- leafexp1 %>% select(pot, soil, genotype, trt=`5E_soil_trts`, leaf_avg=avg_lf_03.24_no_germ)
```


standardize for each gt
```{r}
leafexp1 <- leafexp1 %>%
  group_by(genotype) %>%
  mutate(leaf_avg_std = scale(leaf_avg))
```

```{r}
leafexp1 %>% 
write_csv("leaf_lengths_metabolite.csv")
```
